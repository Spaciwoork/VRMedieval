IDEM Epitech challenge


1. I make sure I have the latest code:

`git pull`

2. I create the branch:

`git checkout -b feature/admin-button-edit`

3. I work with the branch as usual (git add, git commit).

4. As this branch is new only on your computer, you have to push the reference to the remote, only the first time you need to push:

`git push -u origin feature/admin-button-edit`

After the first time, normal `git push`.

5. Follow the link send by github and create a pull request
!! Verify branches

6. Assign creators and reviewers.

8. Merge if all is ok
